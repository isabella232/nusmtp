INTRODUCTION

NuSMTP is a simple wrapper around Ian Baird's SKPSMTPMessage
set of classes.  You can find the original code at:
  http://code.google.com/p/skpsmtpmessage/

SKPSMTPMessage was originally written for the iPhone. I added 
some ifdef's so that it can also be compiled for OS X.

The NuSMTPMessage class adds some utility methods to simplify
the creation of a new SMTP message.  It also has two convenience
methods that simplify adding body text and attachments to 
messages.


USAGE

See the included sample application in the examples directory.

NuSMTPMessage sends SMTP messages asynchronously, so you need
to use it in the context of an application event loop (i.e. it
won't work directly from nush).


INSTALLATION

First build the NuSMTP framework by running "nuke" at the root
directory.  Then run "nuke install" to install the framework
into /Library/Frameworks.

To build the sample application, change to the example 
directory and run "nuke".


AUTHORS
